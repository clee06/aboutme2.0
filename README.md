About Me Page v2.0

Current issues:

Media Query not working on small screen, the Logo and hamburger menu are coming off the NavBar.
I was able to fix this by removing the height property in NavBar in the main css code however without the 80px height the NavBar becomes too large on larger screen sizes.


Lastly an issue with setting animation duration via Javascript, even when declared the animation duration under CSS the animations did not get effected.
